# Retold

> AI-powered resume tailoring tool. Upload your resume once, paste a job description, and get a tailored version in 30 seconds.

Retold is a SaaS application that helps job seekers tailor their resume to specific job descriptions using Claude (Anthropic's AI). It analyzes the job description for keywords and requirements, then restructures and rewrites your resume to match — preserving your authentic voice while optimizing for ATS systems and human reviewers.

## What It Does

- Tailors your resume to a specific job description in under 30 seconds
- Extracts keywords and requirements from the job description
- Restructures bullet points, reorders sections, and surfaces the most relevant experience
- Scores keyword match between your resume and the job description
- Analyzes resume for ATS compatibility issues (tables, fancy bullets, non-standard fonts)
- Generates cover letters on demand
- Produces multiple tailored variations per session (1–3 depending on plan)

## Who It's For

- Job seekers applying to multiple roles who want each application to stand out
- People returning to the workforce adapting their experience to modern job postings
- Career changers framing transferable skills for a new industry
- Anyone whose resume keeps getting filtered out before a human sees it

## How It Works

1. User uploads their base resume (PDF, DOCX, or paste plain text)
2. User pastes a job description and selects tailoring intensity (conservative / moderate / aggressive)
3. Retold calls Claude to restructure the resume for that specific role
4. User views the tailored result with a keyword match score and ATS warnings
5. User copies or downloads the result (DOCX, Markdown, PDF depending on plan)
