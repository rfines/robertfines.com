## Elevator Pitch (30–45 seconds)

> "Every job application is a performance — but most people send the same resume to every role and wonder why they get no callbacks. Tailoring takes 30–45 minutes per application, so most people skip it entirely.
>
> Retold fixes that. You upload your resume once, paste a job description, and in about 30 seconds you get a version of your resume that's been restructured specifically for that role — with a keyword match score and ATS analysis built in. It's not a template filler or keyword stuffer, it's Claude actually rewriting your story for each opportunity.
>
> Free to start, $9.99/month for active job seekers who want file exports, $19.99/month for the full export suite. The market is anyone who applies to jobs — which right now is a very large and very anxious group of people."

## Full Investor Narrative

### The Problem
The modern job application process is broken for candidates. On average, a qualified applicant sends 100–200 applications before receiving a single offer. ATS systems reject ~75% of resumes before a human reviews them. Hiring managers spend 7 seconds on the ones that get through.

The accepted solution is resume tailoring — matching your language, structure, and emphasis to each specific job description. Career coaches charge $150–300/hour to do this. Most candidates either do it badly, skip it entirely, or spend 30–45 minutes per application doing it manually. With people applying to 10–30 roles a week during an active search, that's a part-time job.

### The Solution
Retold takes your base resume, a job description, and recontextualizes your experience for that specific role in under 30 seconds. Unlike template fillers or keyword inserters, it uses Claude to genuinely restructure bullet points, reorder sections, and surface the most relevant experience.

Built-in: keyword match scoring, ATS analysis, cover letter generation, DOCX/MD/PDF export.

### Business Model
Freemium SaaS:
- **Free** — Try it, single variation, copy output
- **Starter ($9.99/mo)** — 2 variations, DOCX/MD export, custom instructions
- **Pro ($19.99/mo)** — 3 variations, PDF export, full suite

Low CAC (SEO + organic), high LTV (job searches last 3–6 months with weekly application volume).

### Market
- TAM: ~80M job seekers in the US per year
- SAM: ~20M actively applying to 5+ jobs/month
- SOM (3yr): ~100K subscribers = $1.2M ARR at $12/mo blended

Tailwinds: tech layoffs, AI accelerating employer-side hiring algorithms, competitive market.

### Competitive Differentiation
| Competitor | Weakness |
|-----------|----------|
| Teal, Kickresume | Template-based, not adaptive |
| ChatGPT directly | No structure, no workflow, no scoring |
| Resume.io / Canva | Design focus, not intelligence |
| ResumeWorded | Scoring but not generation |

Retold preserves your authentic voice while adapting your emphasis for each audience.
