Every developer eventually builds their own site. Here's mine.

## Why

I wanted a place to write about things I'm learning, document side projects, and have a single URL I can hand someone when they ask what I do.

## What to expect

Mostly technical writing — things I've figured out, tools I'm using, ideas worth sharing. Occasional career reflections.

No newsletter. No paywalls. Just writing.
